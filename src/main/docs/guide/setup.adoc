[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `neo4j-bolt` feature to configure the Neo4j Bolt driver in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features neo4j-bolt
----
====

To configure the Neo4j Bolt driver you should first add the `neo4j-bolt` module to your classpath:

dependency::micronaut-neo4j-bolt[groupId="io.micronaut.neo4j", version="{version}"]

NOTE: The 1.x line of `micronaut-neo4j-bolt` supports Neo4j Java Driver 1.x. The latest version of the Neo4j Java Driver is the 4.x line which changes the package name (amongst other breaking API changes) therefore in order to follow semantic versiooning the 2.x line of `micronaut-neo4j-bolt` is dedicated to this version.

You should then configure the URI of the Neo4j server you wish to communicate with in `application.yml`:

.Configuring `neo4j.uri`
[source,yaml]
----
neo4j:
    uri: bolt://localhost
----

TIP: The `neo4j.uri` setting should be in the format as described in the https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/drivers/client-applications/#driver-connection-uris[Connection URIs] section of the Neo4j documentation


Once you have the above configuration in place you can inject an instance of the `org.neo4j.driver.v1.Driver` bean, which features both a synchronous blocking API and a non-blocking API based on `CompletableFuture`.

=== Neo4j Health Checks

When the `micronaut-neo4j-bolt` module is activated a api:neo4j.bolt.health.Neo4jHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/health/CurrentHealthStatus.html[CurrentHealthStatus] interface resolving the health of the Neo4j connection.

See the section on the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] for more information.
