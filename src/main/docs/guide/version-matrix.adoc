- Micronaut Neo4j 6.x uses Neo4j 4.x. It supports Java 11 runtime versions, but does not work with Java 17. To use it in a Micronaut project the dependency needs to specify the `micronaut-neo4j-bolt` version.

dependency::micronaut-neo4j-bolt[groupId="io.micronaut.neo4j", version="{version}"]

- Micronaut Neo4j 5.x uses Neo4j 3.x. It supports Java 8 and 11 runtime versions. To use it in a Micronaut project the version is not required since that is exposed by the BOM.

- A future major version of Neo4j (5.x) is expected to support Java 17.
