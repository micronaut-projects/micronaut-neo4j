You can embed Neo4j for testing by including a dependency on the Neo4j test harness:

dependency:neo4j-harness[groupId="org.neo4j.test", scope="test"]

If the Neo4j server is not already running on the configured port an embedded version will be started.

You can configure the options for the embedded Neo4j server using the `neo4j.embedded` settings exposed by api:neo4j.bolt.Neo4jBoltConfiguration[].

One useful option is `ephemeral` which ensures the data is cleaned up between test runs. For example in `application-test.yml`:

.Using ephemeral
