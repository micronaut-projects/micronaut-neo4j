[TIP]
.Using the CLI
====
If you are creating your project using the Micronaut CLI, supply the `neo4j-bolt` feature to configure the Neo4j Bolt driver in your project:
----
$ mn create-app my-app --features neo4j-bolt
----
====

To configure the Neo4j Bolt driver you should first add the `neo4j-bolt` module to your classpath:

dependency::micronaut-neo4j-bolt[groupId="io.micronaut.neo4j", version="{version}"]

You should then configure the URI of the Neo4j server you wish to communicate with in the `application` configuration file:

.Configuring `neo4j.uri`
[configuration]
----
neo4j:
    uri: bolt://localhost
----

TIP: The `neo4j.uri` setting should be in the format as described in the https://neo4j.com/docs/developer-manual/current/drivers/client-applications/#driver-connection-uris[Connection URIs] section of the Neo4j documentation


Once you have the above configuration in place you can inject an instance of the `org.neo4j.driver.v1.Driver` bean, which features both a synchronous blocking API and a non-blocking API based on `CompletableFuture`.

=== Neo4j Health Checks

When the `micronaut-neo4j-bolt` module is activated a api:neo4j.bolt.health.Neo4jHealthIndicator[] is activated resulting in the `/health` endpoint and https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/health/CurrentHealthStatus.html[CurrentHealthStatus] interface resolving the health of the Neo4j connection.

See the section on the https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#healthEndpoint[Health Endpoint] for more information.
